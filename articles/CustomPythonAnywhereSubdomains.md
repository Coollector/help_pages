Usually custom domain means a domain you own, but we made possible to create
custom subdomains based on username. You could name your web
`whatever-yourusername.pythonanywhere.com` (
or `whatever-yourusername.eu.pythonanywhere.com` on EU system) and it would
work. It's still
available to paid accounts only.
