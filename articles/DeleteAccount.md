## How do I delete my PythonAnywhere account?

Just email us and we can delete all of your files and data from our system --
we'll need to do a quick security check to make sure that it really is you and
not a hacker spoofing emails from your address, though.

    * If your account is on our US system at `www.pythonanywhere.com`, email us
    at [liveusercare@pythonanywhere.com](mailto:liveusercare@pythonanywhere.com)
    * If your account is on our EU system at `eu.pythonanywhere.com`, email us
    at [euusercare@pythonanywhere.com](mailto:euusercare@pythonanywhere.com)
