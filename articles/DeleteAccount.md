## How do I delete my PythonAnywhere account?

Just email us at [usercare@anaconda.com](mailto:usercare@anaconda.com)
and we can delete all of your files and data from our system -- we'll
need to do a quick security check to make sure that it really is you
and not a hacker spoofing emails from your address, though.

If you want your request to be processed quickly and efficiently,
write from the **email address** that you **registered your account**
with, and use the following form:

**Subject**: Delete account "your-username"

**Body**: I request to permanently delete my PythonAnywhere account
"your-username" with all its files and data.
