You have a [certain amount of storage](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/pricing/) on our servers in the form of a home folder and a /tmp.

We've built a file browser which you can use to explore your folders, and download any files you've created. Just go to the [Dashboard](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/dashboard/) (there's a link at the top right of every page) and then click on the [Files](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/files/) tab.

You'll find an "Upload" button appears inside any folders you have write access to. Use this to upload files from your PC.

If you have [ssh access](/pages/SSHAccess) (included in all paid-for accounts), you can also use `scp` (including WinSCP) to copy files up to PythonAnywhere.

From inside the file browser, you can edit text files; find it on the [Files](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/files/) tab, then click its "edit" link, and you'll be taken to [the file editor](/pages/FileEditor). Alternatively, if you prefer to use vim or emacs, you can run them from a bash console.
