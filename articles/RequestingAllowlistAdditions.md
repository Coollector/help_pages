## Why do we have an allowlist?

Our allowlist is in place to prevent malicious users from using *free* accounts
to hack into and generally spam other websites anonymously.

It does not apply to paid accounts, as we can link them to real people via the
payment details -- so they have unrestricted Internet access.


## Requesting an addition to the allowlist

We only add sites to the list if they have an official, public, documented API -- ie, sites
that are designed and intended for machine consumption rather than human consumption.

If you would like us to allowlist a site, you can submit a request 
[on this page](https://support.anaconda.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=12899057104787);
select the "Anaconda Notebooks/PythonAnywhere Allow List Request" option.  You
will need to provide:

* Your email address, so that we can let you know when it's done, or if we have questions.
* A link to the API documentation. Particularly to documentation that states
  the domain where the API is published.
* The domain or domains (including subdomains) that the API is served from.


## GitLab instances

GitLab instances are a special case; we are currently allowing the allowlisting
of any GitLab instance if it has public repositories available on it --
even if it doesn't allow people in general to sign up for accounts.

If you would like a GitLab instance to be allowlisted, send us a link to a
public repository hosted there.
